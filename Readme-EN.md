#### Context:
**CHIC** is an international collaborative space of social design to built new societal dynamics.   
CHIC has the desire to create bridges between the fields of design, applied arts, digital, popular education and social and solidarity economy. In line with the "Do It together", it is intended to develop a new form of production design, to initiate new sociability’s, the "common good" by experimenting with cooperative process of artistic creation and self-production with citizens. 

CHIC is based on a contributory and participatory ecosystem : 
- Uses : reactivation of manual and intellectual know-how, recycling, sharing property, use of local resources and cultural identities. 
- Users : professional trades of creation, makers, residents and employees, associations, communities, universities, youth... 
- Digital technologies : Computer Numerical Control, co-design of contributory research, broadcast management tools...  

**CHIC project develops 3 trends of development :**  
1. Areas of physical and virtual cooperation with transnational & interprofessionnal workshops : experimentation of a design process on a common theme, “the stamp” to create reproducible models in 2D, stamps 3D for a manual (skin stamp, fooding stamps, intdoor and outdoor stamps...), a numericprint machine in copyleft to produce in set patterns, adapted for differents supports (paper, textil, plexi...)
2. Ancorage and dissemination areas in the territories to get in touch with different type of people : young people, inhabitants, elected representatives, professional 
3. Numeric area : creation of the internet platform, of the tools to collaborate and collect all the datas ans informations, cration of maps, to disseminate the results for a large public
